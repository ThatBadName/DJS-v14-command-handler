# DJS-v14-command-handler

An upgraded version of [**Fusion Terror's**](https://www.youtube.com/c/FusionTerror) DJS v14 command handler. I have just made it so that you have the ability to register some commands for just 1 guild (like a test server)

## Setup
- Clone the repo/Download the files and extract them
- Edit config.json with your bots token and test server ID
- Run `npm i` to install all the required packages
- Run `node run bot` to start the bot

Also included a global (/) command deleter. If you wanna delete guild (/)commands you can just kick the bot and re-add it
To run the deleter simply run `node <file-path>`
